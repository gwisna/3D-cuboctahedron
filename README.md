The cuboctahedron_3D_clustering_and_alignment.m is a matlab file that will do the 3D clustering, template alignment and decoding for 3D DNA origami cuboctahedron picks. 

To run the code, download cuboctahedron_3D_clustering_and_alignment.m and the HDF5 file of 0(1)_cuboctahedron_DNA-PAINT.hdf5 and 0(1)_cuboctahedron_DNA-PAINT.yaml.
Place them in the same folder. Then open the .m file.
Run in Matlab. The code has been tested with Matlab R2022a and R2019
The output files are also provided. The result is presented in Figure 5D and 5E.
